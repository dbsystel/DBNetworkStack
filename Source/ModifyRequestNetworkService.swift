 let modifyRequestNetworkService = ModifyRequestNetworkService(networkService: networkService, requestModifications: [ { request in
    return request.added(HTTPHeaderFields: ["API-Key": "SecretKey"])

     Fetches a resource asynchronously from remote location. Execution of the requests starts immediately.
     Execution happens on no specific queue. It dependes on the network access which queue is used.
     Once execution is finished either the completion block or the error block gets called.
     You decide on which queue these blocks get executed.
     
     **Example**:
     ```swift
     let networkService: NetworkService = //
     let resource: Resource<String> = //
     
     networkService.request(queue: .main, resource: resource, onCompletionWithResponse: { htmlText, response in

     })
     ```
     
     - parameter queue: The `DispatchQueue` to execute the completion and error block on.
     - parameter resource: The resource you want to fetch.
     - parameter onCompletionWithResponse: Callback which gets called when fetching and transforming into model succeeds.
     - parameter onError: Callback which gets called when fetching or transforming fails.
     
     - returns: a running network task
