/**
 Mocks a `NetworkService`.
 You can configure expected results or errors to have a fully functional mock.
 
 **Example**:
 ```swift
 //Given
 let networkServiceMock = NetworkServiceMock()
 let resource: Resource<String> = //
 
 //When
 networkService.request(
    resource,
    onCompletion: { string in /*...*/ },
    onError: { error in /*...*/ }
 )
 networkService.returnSuccess(with: "Sucess")
 
 //Then
 //Test your expectations
 
 ```

 It is possible to start multiple requests at a time.
 All requests and responses (or errors) are processed
 in order they have been called. So, everything is serial.

 **Example**:
 ```swift
 //Given
 let networkServiceMock = NetworkServiceMock()
 let resource: Resource<String> = //
 
 //When
 networkService.request(
    resource,
    onCompletion: { string in /* Success */ },
    onError: { error in /*...*/ }
 )
 networkService.request(
    resource,
    onCompletion: { string in /*...*/ },
    onError: { error in /*. cancel error .*/ }
 )

 networkService.returnSuccess(with: "Sucess")
 networkService.returnError(with: .cancelled)

 //Then
 //Test your expectations
 
 ```

     Fetches a resource asynchronously from remote location. Execution of the requests starts immediately.
     Execution happens on no specific queue. It dependes on the network access which queue is used.
     Once execution is finished either the completion block or the error block gets called.
     You decide on which queue these blocks get executed.
     
     **Example**:
     ```swift
     let networkService: NetworkService = //
     let resource: Resource<String> = //
     
     networkService.request(queue: .main, resource: resource, onCompletionWithResponse: { htmlText, response in
     print(htmlText, response)
     }, onError: { error in
     // Handle errors
     })
     ```
     
     - parameter queue: The `DispatchQueue` to execute the completion and error block on.
     - parameter resource: The resource you want to fetch.
     - parameter onCompletionWithResponse: Callback which gets called when fetching and transforming into model succeeds.
     - parameter onError: Callback which gets called when fetching or transforming fails.
     
     - returns: a running network task
