     Fetches a resource asynchronously from remote location. Execution of the requests starts immediately.

     You decide on which queue these blocks get executed.
     
     **Example**:
     ```swift

     networkService.request(queue: .main, resource: resource, onCompletionWithResponse: { htmlText, response in

     })
     ```
     
     - parameter queue: The `DispatchQueue` to execute the completion and error block on.
     - parameter resource: The resource you want to fetch.
     - parameter onCompletionWithResponse: Callback which gets called when fetching and transforming into model succeeds.
     - parameter onError: Callback which gets called when fetching or transforming fails.
     
     - returns: a running network task
